GettingCleaningData
===================

This analysis takes the files from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and creates a tidy data set including:
* Training Data
* Test Data
* Activity labels
* Subject IDs

The data is collected from smartphones while the subjects are performing various tasks/motions.  

There are 30 subjects (age 19-48 years) each performing 6 activities of daily life (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) while wearing the Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist.  Data was collected using the internal gyroscope and accelerometer of the phone in 3 axes of motion (X, Y, and Z).

Data was also examined in the time and frequency domains.  

Our focus is only on measurements of means and standard deviations measurements.
